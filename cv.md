## About me
  I am an environmental researcher and have an MSc degree in Geosciences, currently learning to improve more of my programming skills, so they can be useful in my career as a data analyst, and data scientist, and the job market requires me to own those skills.
  I have a decent professional and educational background and worked for several international companies, but learning new skills and improvement is never bad. I am both a team player and an independent worker, I can work both in the corporate culture teams also remotely.
  I am a reliable, friendly, critical thinker, love traveling, and enjoy fast cooking as an everyday routine, I also like listening to music.
